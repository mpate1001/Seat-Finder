# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-12)

**Core value:** A guest finds their table in under 10 seconds — search, see the number, see it on the map, walk there.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — Fuzzy Search (next)

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 complete; Phase 2 ready to plan
Plan: 3/3 complete in Phase 1
Status: Phase 1 verified — awaiting /gsd-plan-phase 2
Last activity: 2026-04-12 -- Phase 1 verified (3 plans, human UAT passed)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Keep React/Vite/TypeScript stack, no rewrite
- Init: Google Sheets CSV as data source (no backend)
- Init: Data integrity fixed first — all downstream phases depend on correct coordinates

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Table count is still being finalized — floor plan JSON will need updating once table count is locked. Phase 1 (percentage-based coordinates) mitigates the rework cost.
